                <p>
                    <strong>Grant of Rights.</strong>  Users retain ownership rights of Content. However, by uploading and providing Content, Users grant to:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>CITEM and/or the Website:</strong> a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with CITEM’s functions and activities, including for the purpose of promoting the Website</li>
                        <li><strong>Other Users:</strong> a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Website, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Website (such as video playback or embeds).

                    The licenses granted by Users continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after a User removes or deletes Content from the Website.

If CITEM reasonably believes that any Content is in breach of these Terms or may cause harm to the Website, other Users, or third parties, or is in violation of or tends to violate national or local laws, rules, regulations and policies,  CITEM may, at its sole discretion, remove or take down that Content. CITEM may notify Users with the reason for its action unless it reasonably believes that to do so would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for CITEM; compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Website; and/or cause harm to any User or third party.
